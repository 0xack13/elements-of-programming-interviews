    You are given n numbers as well as probabilities p0,p1,...,p(n-1),
    which sum up to 1. Given a random number generator that produces
    values in [0,1] uniformly, how would you getRandom one of the n
    numbers according to the specified probabilities? For example,
    if the numbers are 3, 5, 7, 11, and the probabilities are
    9/18, 6/18, 2/18, 1/18, then in 1000000 calls to your program,
    3 should appear roughly 500000 times,
    5 should appear roughly 333333 times,
    7 should appear roughly 111111 times,
    and 11 should appear roughly 55555 times.
