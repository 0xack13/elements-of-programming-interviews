    The exterior of a binary tree is the following sequence
    of nodes: the nodes from the root to the leftmost leaf,
    followed by teh leaves in the left-to-right order,
    followed by the nodes from the rightmost leaf to the root.
    (By leftmost (rightmost) left, we mean the leaf that appears
    first (last) in an in-order traversal.) For example,
    the exterior of the binary tree in Figure 10.1 on Page 151
    is [A,B,C,D,E,H,M,N,P,O,I].
