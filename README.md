## Elements of Programming Interviews - Java

[![alt text][eopi]][Elements of Programming Interviews]

This repository contains method stubs, tests, and descriptions of the problems from
[Elements Of Programming Interviews] by Adnan Aziz, Tsung-Hsien Lee, and Amit Prakash.  

It contains three branches:
1. [master] - Stable release that only contains correct tests and completed work 
2. [develop] - Contains all incremental updates working towards a release
3. [solutions] - My personal branch where I solve the problems  

Suggested usage:
* Purchase [Elements of Programming Interviews]
* Clone [master]
* Solve a problem on a blackboard/whiteboard/paper/google document
* Program your solution to see if the test cases pass
* Repeat previous two steps until no problems are left

Having trouble solving a problem?
* The book contains hints that I intentionally omitted from this repository
* The book contains thorough solutions
* My (sometimes commented) [solutions] are available

This project is open source so please fork it and help me create a supplement to this phenomenal book. Always looking for edge cases.
