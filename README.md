## Elements of Programming Interviews

This repository contains solutions, tests, and descriptions of the problems from
[Elements Of Programming Interviews] by Adnan Aziz, Tsung-Hsien Lee, and Amit Prakash.  

It contains two branches:
1. [master] - Contains everything.  
2. [no-solutions] - Has only stubbed out methods for the test, but contains all test cases. This is the branch I suggest pulling.  

Suggested usage:  
* Purchase [Elements of Programming Interviews]
* Clone [no-solutions]
* Solve the problems on a blackboard/whiteboard/paper/google document
* Program your solution to see if the test cases pass

Having trouble solving a problem?
* The book contains hints that I intentionally omitted from this repository
* The book contains thorough solutions
* My (sometimes commented) solutions are available in the [master] branch

This project is open source so please fork it and help me create a supplement to this phenomenal book. Always looking for edge cases.
