    Create a cache for looking up prices of books identified
    by their ISBN. You implement lookup, insert, and remove
    methods. Use the Least Recently Used (LRU) policy for
    cache eviction. If an ISBN is already present, insert
    should not change the price, but it should update that
    entry to be the most recently used entry. Lookup should
    also update that entry to be the most recently used entry.
