    Write a program which takes as input a very long sequence
    of numbers and prints the numbers in sorted order. Each
    number is at most k away from its correctly sorted position.
    (Such an array is sometimes referred to as being k-sorted.)
    For example, no number in the sequence [3,-1,2,6,4,5,8]
    is more than two away from its final sorted position.
