    Write a program that takes as input a positive integer n and a size k <= n,
    and returns a size-k subset of {0, 1, 2, ..., n-1}. The subset should be
    represented as an array. All subsets should be equally likely and, in addition,
    all permutations of elements of the array should be equally likely.
    You may assume you have a function which takes as input a non-negative
    integer t and returns an integer in the set {0, 1,...,t-1} with uniform probability.
