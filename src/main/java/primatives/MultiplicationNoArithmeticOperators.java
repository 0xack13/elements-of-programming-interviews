    5.5

    Write a program that multiples two non-negative integers.
    The only operators you are allowed to use are:
        - assignment,
        - bitwise operators >>, <<, |, &, ~, ^, and
        - equality checks and Boolean combinations thereof
    You may use loops and functions that you write yourself.
    These constraints imply, for example, that you cannot
    use increment or decrement, or test if x < y;
